# 🕹️ Classic PONG Game in C# | WinForms Project

Welcome to my beginner-level **PONG game remake**, developed from scratch using **C#** and **Windows Forms** in **Visual Studio 2022**. This project was created to solidify my fundamentals in game logic, UI control, and basic artificial intelligence — without using any game engine like Unity or Godot.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay

- 1 Player vs Computer
- Classic vertical paddle control (keyboard input)
- Ball speed and direction changes randomly on paddle collision
- Computer paddle has AI that adjusts speed randomly
- First to reach 6 points wins

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Pure C# with Windows Forms (no engine)  
✅ Collision detection with `Bounds.IntersectsWith()`  
✅ Player movement using keyboard arrow keys  
✅ Simple AI logic for computer paddle  
✅ Game over conditions with message pop-up  
✅ Random speed dynamics for realism

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Building a game loop using `Timer` in WinForms
- Handling user input with `KeyDown`/`KeyUp` events
- Object movement and collision detection
- Structuring code between logic and UI (Form Designer)
- Adding random behavior to simulate AI
